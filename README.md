anything you would like us to know about your program (like errors, special conditions, etc.):
- I tested each part heavily, so I am not aware of any errors. I followed the instructions carefully, so there are no special conditions as far as I am concerned. 
- AI usage: I used AI to help with the Makefile. I was unfamiliar with the code for the Makefile, so I used chatGBT to help with that. I also used AI throughout the program if I was stuck with implementing something. Mostly used to set me on the right track.
