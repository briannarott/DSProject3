instructions to run my code:
1. make clean
2. make
3. docker build . -t prj3

HOW TO RUN 4 TESTCASES DESCRIBED IN INSTRUCTIONS:
4. TESTCASE1:  docker compose -f docker-compose-testcase-1.yml up
- stop in docker desktop when done, make clean and rebuild
5. TESTCASE2:  docker compose -f docker-compose-testcase-2.yml up
- stop in docker desktop when done, make clean and rebuild
6. TESTCASE3:  docker compose -f docker-compose-testcase-3.yml up 
- stop in docker desktop when done, make clean and rebuild
7. TESTCASE3:  docker compose -f docker-compose-testcase-4.yml up 
- stop in docker desktop when done, make clean and rebuild

anything you would like us to know about your program (like errors, special conditions, etc.):
- To run test 2 and 3, it is be best to start over, meaning 'make clean,' 'make,' and rebuild. Then run the test.
- I tested each part heavily, so I am not aware of any errors. I followed the instructions carefully, so there are no special conditions as far as I am concerned. All 3 testcases have passed everytime I have run them. In checking my work for this assignment, I ran each testcase 5 additional times to ensure the entire project works as intended. 
- AI usage: I used AI to help with the Makefile. I was unfamiliar with the code for the Makefile, so I used chatGBT to help with that. I also used AI throughout the project if I was stuck with the logic in implementing something. Mostly used to set me on the right track. Helped with debugging and printing debugging messages.
